        <!-- Description of Content -->
            <article id = "article">
                Horizon: Forbidden West is an upcoming PS4 and PS5 game by Guerilla Games Studio. Currently scheduled to be
                released in February 2022, Horizon: Forbidden West is the sequel to Guerilla's 2017 RPG Horizon: Zero Dawn.
                The gameplay reveal trailer shows new machines, locations, and abilities that will be in Forbidden West, as well as 
                showing the game's updated graphics.
                Personally, I hope to see characters from Horizon: Zero Dawn return in Forbidden West, and to resolve
                some of the storylines that the previous game left open. A few characters have already been confirmed to return,
                though very little of the plot of the new game has been revealed beyond what is shown in the original trailer and the 
                above State of Play trailer. A major strength of the first Horizon: Zero Dawn game was its characters and storytelling,
                so it would be good to see both return in the new game. I particularily like the way that Horizon: Zero Dawn handled
                side quests; many RPGs tend to suffer from having too many sidequests that tend to get boring and repetitive, or add little
                to the story, worldbuilding, or characters. HZD had fewer sidequests than most RPGs, but all of them were long, detailed,
                and interesting to play through. I would like to see Horizon: Forbidden West follow the same idea.
